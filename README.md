# ULLD Development CLI

This is cli is just used for internal development of the [UhLittleLessDum](https://uhlittlelessdum.com) note taking framework. If you are planning to contribute to ULLD, install this cli in your global `GOPATH`, otherwise this package won't be able to do much for you. Even for user's attempting to extend or modify their generated app, this cli can't offer much of a benefit outside of the structured ULLD development environment.
